#Description: Code that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modular division, and exponential equations.

#Adds 3 and 250
sum_add=3+250

#Finds the difference between 3 and -250
difference = 3-250

#Finds the product of 3, 2, and 5
product = 3*2*5

#Finds the quotient of 251 divided by 6
quotient = 251/6

#Finds 2 to the power of 3
exponent = 2**3

#Find the remainder when dividing 27 by 17
remainder = 27%17
