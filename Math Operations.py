#Description: Code that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modular division, and exponential equations.

#Adds 3 and 250
sum_add=3+250

#Finds the difference between 3 and -250
difference = 3-250

#Finds the product of 3, 2, and 5
product = 3*2*5

#Finds the quotient of 251 divided by 6
quotient = 251/6

#Finds 2 to the power of 3
exponent = 2**3

#Find the remainder when dividing 27 by 17
remainder = 27%17

#Prints Sum
print("This is the sum of 3 and 250: " + str(sum_add))

#Prints Difference
print("This is the difference between 3 and -250: " + str(difference))

#Prints Product
print("This is the product of 3,2 and 5: " + str(product))

#Prints Quotient
print("This is the quotient when 251 is divided by 6: " + str(quotient))

#Prints Exponent
print("This is the result of 2 to the power 3: " + str(exponent))

#Prints Remainder
print("This is the remainder when 27 is divided by 17: " + str(remainder))
